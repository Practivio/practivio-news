Scene:
Dynamic camera swoops through the twilight European skies, focusing on three species of bats in flight. The visuals transition to close-ups of ultra-light sensors attached to greater noctule bats, their wingspan illuminated by the fading sunlight. The perspective shifts, providing a bird's eye view of the bats as they zero in on unsuspecting prey.
