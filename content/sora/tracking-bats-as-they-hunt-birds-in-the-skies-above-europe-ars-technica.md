# Tracking bats as they hunt birds in the skies above Europe - Ars Technica

```sora
Scene:
The camera pans through a moonlit European sky, focusing on a constellation of Nyctalus Iasiopterus bats, their reddish-brown fur glinting under the soft light. The view transitions to an ultralight sensor, suspended from one bat's wingtip, capturing its nocturnal flight. The screen adjusts, revealing a bird soaring gracefully in the distance. Suddenly, the bat lunges, the scene freezes for a heartbeat before resuming with the bird plummeting, pursued by the swift predator. Narration (voice of @lee627):"Witness the brutal grace of nature as we unveil the hunting tactics of bats that feast on birds. Could this shed new light on our understanding of these fascinating creatures? #BatResearch #EuropeanSkies #NoctuleBats #PredatorBehavior #AvianFeasting #NightlyHunts"
