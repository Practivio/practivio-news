Scene: A dynamic montage of the Caribbean Seaâ€”the turquoise waves pulsating with the rhythmic hum of Tropical Storm Melissa. The camera dives beneath the surface, showing swirling currents before gliding over vibrant coral reefs and coastal communities. We transition to aerial shots showcasing flood-prone areas in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, as residents hurriedly secure tarps and prepare for heavy rainfall. The scene shifts to Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, where streets are already flooded. The tone is tense yet hopeful, with a somber undercurrent. Narration (voice of @lee627):"Tropical Storm Melissa intensifies in the Caribbean, bringing flood risks to Jamaica and Hispaniola. Officials urge residents to seek higher ground.
