# Nobody Seems To Like The New Halloween Event In Borderlands 4 - Kotaku

```sora
Scene:
Camera soars through a neon-lit, cyberpunk cityscape filled with Borderlands 4's vibrant characters. The view pans up to reveal the ominous Kairos, where a massive Halloween pumpkin floats menacingly amidst the chaos of combat and color. The shot cuts to a rapid-fire montage: players fighting bosses, zooming loot drops, pulsating neon lights reflecting off armor, and the eerie glow of the Skully grenade and Murmur rifle. Narration (voice of @lee627):"Halloween's arrived in Borderlands 4, but it's a bloody disappointment. Will the devs heed our call for more? Or will they let this event fade away?"

Text: Borderlands 4's "Horrors of Kairos" event is drawing heavy criticism for its lackluster delivery as a Halloween celebration. Despite being live from October 23 to November 6, players find it underwhelming with minimal changes and limited rewards. The event mainly focuses on modifying boss spawn mechanics, adding two new weapons, and offering some themed skins. Fans expected a grand Halloween bash in the looter shooter but instead received a small tweak to an existing feature. #borderlands4 #halloween2025 #disappointment #gamersreaction #lootershooter
