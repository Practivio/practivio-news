# Nobody Seems To Like The New Halloween Event In Borderlands 4 - Kotaku

```sora
Scene: The camera glides through the neon-lit streets of Pandora, zooming in on a group of Vault Hunters huddled around their screens. As the music swells, the camera pans up, revealing the digital chaos of Borderlands 4's Horrors of Kairos event in full swing. The visuals pulse with energy, transitions seamlessly between gameplay and character interactions, all set against a backdrop of a hauntingly beautiful Pandora under the moonlight.
Narration (voice of @lee627):"Borderlands 4's 'Horrors of Kairos' event is live, but players are less than enthused. With minimal changes and a lackluster celebration, it seems the Halloween spirit has bypassed this looter shooter."
