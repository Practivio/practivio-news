Scene:
The camera spirals above Seattle's bustling skyline, panning over Alaska Airlines' planes scattered on the tarmac like a constellation disrupted. The atmosphere darkens, reflecting the airline's turbulent state. As we zoom in, the screen splits, showcasing the impacted passengersâ€”49,000 faces of frustration and disappointment. Narration (voice of @lee627):"An IT failure grounds Alaska Airlines, stranding 49,000 passengers. While safety is critical, reliability is an expectation. Will they regain trust?"
