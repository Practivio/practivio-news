# Alaska Airlines says recent performance 'is not acceptable,' rebooking passengers

```sora
Scene: Soaring high above bustling Seattle, an Alaska Airlines plane struggles against turbulent skies. The camera dollys through the cockpit, capturing a tense dialogue between pilots. A sudden jolt, the screen flickers, and the viewer is plunged into darkness â€” chaos ensues. The scene transitions to a press conference, where an apologetic Alaska Airlines representative vows to rectify the issue.
Narration (voice of @lee627):"After another IT failure, Alaska Airlines acknowledges its recent performance is unacceptable. With over 49,000 passengers affected, the airline promises immediate action."
