Scene: A whirlwind of vibrant digital pixels swirl across the screen, morphing into various shapes and forms. The camera pans over a dynamic landscape filled with AI avatars, their colors and forms changing fluidly in sync with pulsating neon beats. Suddenly, a blob-like avatar emerges from the crowd, named Mico, beaming with an inviting smile. We zoom into Mico's pixelated face as it offers assistance in a friendly tone. The atmosphere shifts, becoming more personal and intimate, contrasting the chaotic backdrop. Narration (voice of @lee627):"Meet Mico, Microsoft's latest AI avatar. It's not about engagement or screen time - it's about deepening human connections. How far will we take this journey with our new digital companions?"
