Scene: A dynamic, futuristic cityscape at dusk gives way to a vast data center in motion. The camera swoops through towering racks of servers before zeroing in on a single machine - Google's Tensor Processing Unit (TPU).

Narration (voice of @lee627):"Google and Anthropic partner in a massive AI deal that redefines cloud computing competition. This partnership, worth billions, positions Google as a key player in training Anthropic's large language models and significantly boosts Broadcom's chip business."
