Scene: A dynamic, 9:16 cinematic clip opens with a sweeping view of the Earth from space, transitioning seamlessly into Google's iconic colorful logo, pulsating and expanding. The camera dives into the depths of data centers, panning over rows of gleaming servers, before zooming in on a single server rack â€” home to thousands of Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). A burst of light signifies Anthropic's agreement with Google, and we see TPUs being connected like stars in the night sky. The camera then moves into the orbit, where Google's constellation of TPUs shines bright against the cosmic backdrop, symbolizing the immense power now at Anthropic's disposal. Narration (voice of @lee627):"Google's deal with Anthropic brings one million TPUs to life, changing the game for AI companies and cloud providers alike. Will this partnership reshape the future of AI? Find out on our channel."
