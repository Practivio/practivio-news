# Kevin Federline Says Sons Are 'Terrified' to See Mom Britney Spears After Recent Visits - TooFab

```sora
Scene: The camera sweeps through a dynamic montage of bright studio lights and microphones, intercut with shots of Piers Morgan's Uncensored podcast set. As the music builds, we transition to intimate family portraits of Kevin Federline and his sons, Sean Preston, and Jayden. The visuals shift, panning over scenes of each boy, their expressions increasingly concerned. We cut to footage of Britney Spears on stage, her vibrant performances juxtaposed with the boys' anxious faces. As the camera zooms out, we see Federline in a dimly lit room, speaking candidly about their troubled relationship. Narration (voice of @lee627):"Kevin Federline claims his sons have stopped seeing Britney Spears due to recent visits. The 19-year-old Jayden and 20-year-old Sean Preston are reportedly 'terrified' for their mother."
