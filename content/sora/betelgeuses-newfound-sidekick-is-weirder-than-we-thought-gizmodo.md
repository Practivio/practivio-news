# Betelgeuse’s Newfound Sidekick Is Weirder Than We Thought - Gizmodo

Scene:
The camera orbits through cosmic dust, stars twinkling in the background, focusing on Betelgeuse – a red supergiant nearing its end, pulsating rhythmically. Suddenly, a younger star, "Betelbuddy", emerges from behind, smaller and more vibrant. The shot transitions to X-ray imagery, showcasing the Chandra Observatory capturing Betelbuddy's intense energy bursts. Cut back to space, as both stars dance in an intricate cosmic waltz against a vast, dark canvas – their proximity defying initial expectations. Narration (voice of @lee627):"In the unfathomable depths of space, a stellar dance defies the norm. Betelgeuse's companion, Betelbuddy, is proving weirder than anticipated. How far will our understanding stretch with each orbit?"

Title: Betelgeuse’s Newfound Sidekick Is Weirder Than We Thought - Gizmodo
Category: science
Text: Reading time: 3 minutes A couple months back, astronomers officially confirmed the existence of “Betelbuddy,” Betelgeuse’s long-suspected companion star. Since then, researchers have been toiling away at characterizing Betelbuddy—finding that with each observation, the star drifts further away from initial expectations. A recent study published in The Astrophysical Journal presents a thorough analysis of Betelbuddy using data gathered by NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Hubble Space Telescope. In the “deepest X-ray observations of Betelgeuse to date,” researchers found that Betelbuddy is most likely a young stellar object (YSO) about the size of our Sun. This affirms a separate, earlier study that predicted Betelbuddy’s striking youth compared to Betelgeuse, a red supergiant nearing the end of its stellar lifespan. At the same time, the findings usurp several assumptions astronomers have made about the nature of Betelbuddy’s stellar composition. The project was a “race against time,” the researchers describe in a statement, as it managed to catch Betelbuddy in the nick of time before it disappeared behind its companion for the next two years. The Gemini North Telescope captured this cosmic dance between stars in stunning detail. Could this rewrite what we know?
