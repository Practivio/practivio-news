# Company recalls 2M pounds of jerky sold at Costco and Sam's Club that may contain metal wire

```sora
Scene: A seamless blend of dynamic shots ‚Äì the camera zooms out from a crowded Costco and Sam's Club storefront, revealing busy shoppers hurriedly pushing carts, before transitioning to a swift pan over rows upon rows of jerky packages. The camera then homes in on the problematic Golden Island jerky pouches, their labels shimmering against the dim lighting. In the background, the production line at LSI, Inc., is depicted ‚Äì conveyor belts whirring, products flying past, and a sudden, sharp focus on an ominous-looking piece of metal amongst them. Narration (voice of @lee627):"Shelf lives extended... but not safety measures. Contaminated jerky recalled from Costco and Sam's Club stores across the nation. Keep your eyes peeled for Golden Island pork jerky, or better yet ‚Äì avoid the risk altogether."
