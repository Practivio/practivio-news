# JPMorgan Chase wants out of paying $115M legal tab for convicted fraudsters

```sora
Scene: A dynamic, high-contrast close-up of the JPMorgan Chase logo transitions to a bustling New York City courtroom, camera panning through the crowd before zooming in on the defendants. The scene shifts to a montage of legal documents being shuffled, lawyers conferring, and the defendants in their cells, all intercut with the bank's towering skyscraper and its symbolic dollar sign. The cinematic tone builds as the court ruling is delivered, followed by a drone shot over the city at dusk, ending with a handheld close-up of the court documents being signed.
Narration (voice of @lee627):"In a landmark decision, JPMorgan Chase seeks to absolve itself from an astronomical legal bill racked up by convicted fraudsters Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar. How would you respond if this happened near you?"
