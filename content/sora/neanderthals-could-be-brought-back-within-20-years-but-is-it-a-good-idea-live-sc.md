Scene: A dynamic, sweeping view of a modern lab morphs into an ancient cave, illuminated by flickering firelight. The camera zooms in on a humanoid figure â€” a Neanderthal, then cuts to present-day scientists working tirelessly. A dramatic transition showcases the bustling cityscape of Cambridge, Massachusetts, home to Harvard University and Colossal Biosciences.
