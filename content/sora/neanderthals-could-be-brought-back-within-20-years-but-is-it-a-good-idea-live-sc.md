# Neanderthals could be brought back within 20 years ‚Äî but is it a good idea? - Live Science

```sora
Scene: The camera sweeps across a bustling lab filled with whirring machinery, pulsating lights, and humming screens. Zoom in on a vial containing a Neanderthal genome sequence, which floats upwards as particles of information burst around it. Suddenly, the vial splits open, releasing shimmering DNA strands that swirl and intertwine with human stem cells in suspended animation. The scene shifts to a vast, futuristic cityscape at night, where an adventurous woman‚Äîour surrogate‚Äîstands alone on a rooftop, looking out into the distant cosmos.
Narration (voice of @lee627):"Could we bring back Neanderthals? One pioneer says 'Yes'. What does this mean for our future? Could you bear witness to history in the making?"
