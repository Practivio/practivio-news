Scene: The screen transitions from a bustling cityscape to a high-tech laboratory, where tiny drone parts swirl around in a vortex. The camera pans over the components, zooming in on each piece before flying through a series of wind tunnels and sensor tests. As the drone assembles itself, it emerges into an urban jungle, its propellers whirring in anticipation. The scene shifts to satellite imagery of Earth, with the drone moving closer until it's just outside someone's window, ready to take flight. Narration (voice of @lee627):"A sequel to the infamous DJI Neo is rumored to be unleashed. Will it haunt your neighborhood? Keep an eye out for its chilling scream."
