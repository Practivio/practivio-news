Scene:
Camera swoops through a swirling vortex, revealing a vast expanse of prehistoric North America. We zoom in on lush green landscapes, dense forests, and towering mountains ‚Äî all teeming with colossal dinosaurs. The scene transitions to a lab filled with scientists working meticulously around a large fossilized bone. As they piece together evidence, the camera pans over maps showing North America and dates counting down to 66 million years ago. Narration (voice of @lee627):"New findings suggest dinosaurs thrived even on the brink of extinction. Could this rewrite what we thought about their demise?"
