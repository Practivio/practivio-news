Text: Ford shares reached their highest level since July 2024 in Friday morning trading. On the first trading session since Ford reported its third-quarter earnings, the automaker is on pace for its best day in the stock market since January 2022. Ford shares are up about 10% on Friday morning, with investors pouring into the company as it tackles EV losses and fallout from a devastating fire that slammed a major aluminum supplier. The results are even more notable considering Ford already had one of its best days of the year earlier this week, closing up more than 4% on Tuesday in sympathy with Detroit rival GM, which surged on a big profit guidance hike. Investors’ optimism seems to have less to do with Ford’s current performance — the automaker lowered the top range of its full-year EBIT forecast by $1 billion — and more to do with the steps it’s taking to clean things up. Ford lost $1.4 billion on EVs on the quarter, the unit’s deepest loss since 2023. That result came in spite of a sales surge as customers raced to qualify for the expiring $7,500 EV tax credit. On the company’s earnings call Thursday, CEO Jim Farley said he believes EV adoption will be about 5% of the US market, suggesting Ford's efforts could be game-changing. #Ford #EVrevolution #StockMarket #BusinessNews #AutomobileIndustry
