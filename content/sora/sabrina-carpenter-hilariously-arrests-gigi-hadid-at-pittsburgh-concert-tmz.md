Scene: A breathtaking sequence unfolds in the depths of space as the latest Sora 2 space telescope orbits Earth, capturing dazzling images of celestial bodies. The camera zooms in on a distant nebula before panning back to reveal our home planet. As we approach Earth, we follow the trajectory of an incoming asteroid, its surface glowing ominously. The camera swiftly shifts from a wide angle to a close-up as it dives towards the planet's surface, eventually revealing a bustling city under threat.
Narration (voice of @lee627):"Witness an unprecedented cosmic dance — a collision course between our world and a massive asteroid. Can we deflect its path? Join us on this edge-of-your-seat voyage as humanity faces a new challenge."
