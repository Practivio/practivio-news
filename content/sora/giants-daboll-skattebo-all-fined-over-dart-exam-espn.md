Scene: A dynamic, high-speed montage showcases the bustling NFL field, with the camera panning over players warming up, coaches strategizing in slow motion, and the crowd roaring. The focus shifts to a close-up of Jaxson Dart as he takes a hit during a game against the Philadelphia Eagles. The camera then switches to a bird's-eye view, showcasing the blue medical tent below. As the tense music builds, we see a swift pan of Coach Brian Daboll approaching the tent, followed by Cam Skattebo entering. The scene transitions to Dr. Scott Rodeo discussing with an offscreen referee. The atmosphere shifts from excitement to suspense as we return to the field, where Daboll is seen animatedly conversing with Dr. Rodeo on the sidelines. Narration (voice of @lee627):"Today's headlines: The NFL fines the Giants, coach Brian Daboll, and Cam Skattebo for violating concussion protocol.
