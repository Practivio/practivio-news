# Giants, Daboll, Skattebo all fined over Dart exam - ESPN

```sora
Scene: A dynamic, slow-motion close-up of a football, illuminated by the stadium lights. The camera zooms out, tracking the trajectory of the ball through the air, as the crowd roars in anticipation. Suddenly, the shot cuts to a quick succession of shots - coach Daboll's intense expression, the blue medical tent, Dr. Rodeo conferring with players, and finally, a replay showing the hit on QB Jaxson Dart. The scene transitions seamlessly into a conversation between Daboll and Rodeo, their voices echoing in the stadium silence.
Narration (voice of @lee627):"The NFL has fined the Giants, coach Brian Daboll, and Cam Skattebo following a violation of concussion protocol during Week 6's game. What do you think happens next?"
