# Indie shooter Escape From Duckov overtakes Battlefield 6 on Steam - Dexerto

```sora
Scene:
The camera starts with a bird's-eye view of a bustling Steam platform. A whirlwind of vibrant pixelated graphics swirl around, suddenly focusing on "Escape From Duckov" and "Battlefield 6". The scene zooms into each game's cover art, then cuts to rapid-fire shots of gameplay - Battlefield's grand battles contrasting with Duckov's chaotic duck warfare. The visuals transition seamlessly to a split screen, demonstrating the concurrent player counts in real-time - Battlefield 6's numbers decreasing while Duckov's surges. The screen pulsates with the rhythm of a heartbeat, symbolizing the shifting tides. Narration (voice of @lee627):"A niche indie experiment overtakes one of the biggest shooters of the year. Could this rewrite what we know about gaming?"
