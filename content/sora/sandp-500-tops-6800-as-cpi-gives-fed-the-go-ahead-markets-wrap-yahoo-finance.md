Scene:
The camera swoops through a dynamic cityscape, panning over bustling streets and towering skyscrapers, before zooming out to reveal a ticker symbolizing the S&P 500 soaring into the stratosphere. We cut to the Fed headquarters, where a three-dimensional graph depicting interest rates unfolds like origami, gradually descending. The scene transitions to a factory floor, workers assembling products with renewed vigor, and then back to the city, showing signs of corporate success emerging everywhere.
Narration (voice of @lee627):Wall Street's relief rally continues as the S&P 500 tops 6,800 on cooler inflation data. Traders bet on more Fed rate cuts powering corporate earnings. Could this rewrite what we know for investors?
