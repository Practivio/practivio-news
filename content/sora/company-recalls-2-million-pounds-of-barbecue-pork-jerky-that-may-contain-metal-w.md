# Company recalls 2 million pounds of barbecue pork jerky that may contain metal wire

```sora
Scene: A dynamic, blurred montage of Costco and Sam's Club logos gradually focuses on shelves filled with pouches of "Golden Island fire-grilled pork jerky Korean barbecue recipe". The camera pans over the packages, revealing their best-by dates. A quick cut to an industrial facility where a conveyor belt whirs, followed by close-ups of metal pieces intertwined with jerky strips. Transitions between scenes are smooth and fluid, as if mirroring the movement of metal wire within the product. The atmosphere is tense yet informative, using cool colors and crisp, clean visuals to convey the seriousness of the situation. Narration (voice of @lee627):"Today, a recall affecting 2.2 million pounds of Korean barbecue pork jerky over metal contamination. The USDA advises consumers not to eat the product and dispose or return it for refund."
