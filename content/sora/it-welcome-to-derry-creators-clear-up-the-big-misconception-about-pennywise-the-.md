# ‘IT: Welcome to Derry’ Creators Clear Up the Big “Misconception” About Pennywise - The Hollywood Reporter

```sora
Scene:
The camera swoops over a small Maine town, 1962. The atmosphere is chilling, with a moody grey sky casting long shadows. Panning across the town square, we see people going about their day - children laughing, adults working, but always in the background, a haunting sense of unease. As the camera zooms in on a newspaper headline, "IT: Welcome to Derry", it transitions to a montage of creepy images: a rusty old well, a child's lost balloon floating eerily, a shadowy figure lurking in the darkness. Narration (voice of @lee627):"Step back into Derry, where fear takes shape. 'IT: Welcome to Derry' premieres this Sunday. Dive deeper into the IT universe."
