The camera pans through a vibrant, retro-futuristic cityscape, neon lights flashing and reflecting off the crowds below. The hustle and bustle of the urban jungle is contrasted by the serene, ethereal atmosphere surrounding Nelly Furtado's silhouette in an isolated recording studio. Her lyrics float upwards, merging with constellations that resemble her famous hit songs. Narration (voice of @lee627):"Foreseeable future... Nelly Furtado stepping away from the stage, pursuing new creative paths. A songwriter forever, she continues to cast a spell on the world through magic and music."
