# Listen to The Creepy 'Sounds' From A Black Hole, Captured by NASA - ScienceAlert

Scene:
The camera pans over a star-studded cosmic backdrop, zooming into the Perseus Cluster. We glide through nebulae and galaxies, eventually focusing on a colossal black hole pulsating with energy. The shot transitions to an auditory perspective, displaying swirling sound waves emanating from the black hole. As the waves reach Earth, they are transposed up 57 and 58 octaves and transformed into howling noises.
Narration (voice of @lee627):"Hear the haunting cries from a distant cosmic predator - the first sound ever detected from a black hole. How far can we probe the mysteries of the Universe?"

Text: NASA created a haunting audio clip of sound waves rippling out of a supermassive black hole, located 250 million light-years away. The black hole is at the center of the Perseus cluster of galaxies, and the acoustic waves coming from it have been transposed up 57 and 58 octaves so they're audible to human hearing. The result, released by NASA in 2022, is a sort of unearthly (obviously) howling that, if we're honest, sounds not only spooky, but a little bit angry. Listen to the sounds in the clip below: It was the first time these sound waves had been extracted and made audible. So what's going on here? We might not be able to hear sound in space, but that doesn't mean there isn't any. Related: Sound of a Black Hole 'Kicked' Through Space Heard in a Stunning First In 2003, astronomers detected something truly astonishing: acoustic waves propagating through the copious amounts of gas surrounding the supermassive black hole at the centre of the Perseus galaxy cluster, which is now renowned for its eerie wails. We wouldn't be able to hear them at their current pitch. The waves include the lowest note in the Universe ever detected by humans – well below the limits of human hearing. But what does this mean for our understanding of the cosmos? How will it change the way we explore and interpret the sounds of space? Dare to journey deeper into the cosmic mysteries! 🚀🔊✨🌍 #BlackHoleSound #NASA #SpaceSounds #PerseusCluster #CosmicMysteries
