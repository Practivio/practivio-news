# Listen to The Creepy 'Sounds' From A Black Hole, Captured by NASA - ScienceAlert

```sora
Scene: A breathtaking, 9:16 panorama of space unfolds as we soar through the cosmos towards a distant galaxy cluster. The camera dives into the heart of the Perseus cluster, where a supermassive black hole hums with a deep, otherworldly growl. The sound echoes across the void, transposed to frequencies audible to human ears.
Narration (voice of @lee627):"Listen to the haunting howls from a black hole, 250 million light-years away. What might this unearthly music reveal about the cosmos?"
