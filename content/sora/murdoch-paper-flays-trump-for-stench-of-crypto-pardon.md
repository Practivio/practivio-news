# Murdoch Paper Flays Trump For ‘Stench’ of Crypto Pardon

```sora
Scene:
A whirling kaleidoscope of screens, each displaying headlines about Donald Trump and Changpeng Zhao, blur into focus. The camera pans over the New York skyline at night, landing on the iconic Wall Street Journal building. The interior reveals journalists huddled around computers, their fingers flying over keyboards as they type furiously. The scene transitions to a bustling crowd at a tech conference, where Zhao is giving a speech. His words are drowned out by the cacophony of voices debating his actions. The camera zooms in on the Binance logo, which pulsates with energy before fading into the vast expanse of space, where the James Webb Space Telescope orbits silently against a backdrop of swirling galaxies. Narration (voice of @lee627):"The Wall Street Journal questions Trump's motives in pardoning cryptocurrency kingpin Changpeng Zhao. Will the war on crypto truly end with this move? What do you think?"
