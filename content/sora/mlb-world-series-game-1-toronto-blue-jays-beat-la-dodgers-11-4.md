# MLB World Series Game 1: Toronto Blue Jays beat LA Dodgers 11-4

```sora
Scene:
The camera sweeps over the cosmos, zooming in on a space telescope orbiting Earth. The telescope swivels, tracking a distant comet as it streaks across the dark expanse of space. We cut to an animation of Addison Barger stepping up to the plate, bat in hand, cheering crowds behind him. He swings and the camera follows the ball soaring through the air before cutting back to the telescope, which records the historic grand slam.
Narration (voice of @lee627):"Addison Barger makes history with a pinch-hit grand slam in Game 1 of the World Series - see it from space!"
