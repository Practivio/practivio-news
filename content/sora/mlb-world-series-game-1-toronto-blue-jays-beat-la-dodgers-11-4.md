Text: Making his MLB debut in 2024, rookie sensation Addison Barger began the 2025 season in the minor leagues. However, on October 27th, 2025, he wrote his name into World Series history as he smashed the first grand slam by a pinch-hitter in World Series history, propelling the Toronto Blue Jays to an 11-4 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 1 of the 'Fall Classic'. With an expectant crowd packed into Canada's Rogers Centre for the first World Series game since 1993, the Blue Jays scored nine runs in the bottom of the sixth inning, leaving the defending champions reeling. Not even a home run from Japanese superstar Shohei Ohtani could save the Dodgers as they struggle to find their footing against Toronto's relentless onslaught. The series is now tied at 1-1 as it heads to Los Angeles for Game 2. Will the Blue Jays continue their dominant performance, or will the Dodgers fight back?
