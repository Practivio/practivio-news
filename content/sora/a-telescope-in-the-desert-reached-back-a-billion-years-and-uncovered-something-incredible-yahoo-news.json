      "[establishing] A calm, clear night sky over the Murchison Widefield Array telescope in Western Australia.",

    "VoiceOver": "@lee627, 'A new study led by Cathryn Trott suggests that the epoch of reionization began with some heating in the early universe. This challenges previous theories suggesting a cold start for this period.' Comment below.",
    "Ending": "[closing] The researchers found evidence against very cold reionization, indicating potential x-rays from early black holes or stellar remnants caused some of the heating around 800 million years after Big Bang."
