    "body_html": "<p>A new study led by Cathryn Trott from Curtin University, using data collected over ten years with the Murchison Widefield Array telescope in Western Australia, suggests that reionization of neutral hydrogen atoms began when some heating was already occurring. This challenges previous theories suggesting a 'cold start' for this period.</p> <p>The epoch of reionization occurred about one billion years after the Big Bang and marked an era where ionized light from first stars and galaxies stripped electrons away from hydrogen atoms, transforming them into plasma. The study found no evidence supporting a very cold start to reionization.</p> <p>The researchers analyzed frequencies of neutral hydrogen emission between 70–300 MHz as the universe expanded and cooled after Big Bang's initial explosive event, looking for signs that would indicate heating. Instead, they found evidence against a cold start scenario by not detecting expected signals.</p> <p>The study suggests x-ray emissions from early black holes or stellar remnants could be responsible for this preliminary warming of the universe's hydrogen atoms around 800 million years after Big Bang, although direct evidence has yet to surface. The findings are significant as they offer insights into galaxy formation and evolution during a pivotal era in cosmic history.</p> <p>The Murchison Widefield Array telescope's purpose-built design for detecting neutral hydrogen emission makes it an ideal tool for this research, providing data that has allowed scientists to refine their understanding of the universe’s early days. The absence of a cold start signal in current observations suggests further investigation and more extensive datasets are needed.</p> <p>The study's findings have broader implications on our comprehension of how galaxies formed, evolved during this timeframe, and contributed to shaping today's universe as we know it. As the researchers continue refining their techniques for filtering out cosmic noise from other sources like Earth’s atmosphere or nearby stars/galaxies, they anticipate uncovering more about these early events.</p>"
