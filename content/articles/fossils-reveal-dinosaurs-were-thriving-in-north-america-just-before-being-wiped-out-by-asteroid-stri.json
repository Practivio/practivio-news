    "body_html": "<p>Scientists have uncovered evidence that dinosaurs were not in decline before a catastrophic asteroid strike 66 million years ago, as previously thought. A study published on October 24, 2025, analyzing fossils from the Kirtland Formation in New Mexico reveals these creatures continued to flourish up until their abrupt extinction event.</p> <p><strong>Key findings:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Fossils date back around 400,000 years before the asteroid impacted Earth.</li> <li>The presence of Tyrannosaurus rex and a Triceratops-like herbivore among other dinosaur species indicates diverse communities thriving at that time.</li> <li>Magnetic minerals in rocks helped determine the age, while volcanic glass particles provided additional dating accuracy.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Implications:</strong></p> <p>The study's lead author Daniel Peppe suggests these findings challenge previous beliefs about dinosaur decline and could reshape our understanding of their final days. The research team, including paleontologist Steve Brusatte from the University of Edinburgh, emphasizes that while this site provides valuable insights into New Mexicoâ€™s prehistoric ecosystem, it represents just one snapshot in time.</p> <p><strong>Researcher's Perspective:</strong></p> <p>"
