  "full_text": "Reading time: Reading time 3 minutes\n\nDronemaker DJI is hinting that we could be in store for one last drone launch before the end of the year. However, leakers already have spoilers for what appears to be a sequel to the small, cheap, and incredibly loud DJI Neo drone. The little drone could scream as loud as a banshee’s wail, which makes it the perfect doohickey to bring us frights before All Hallows’ Eve. However, it likely won’t be coming to the U.S. anytime soon over the government’s own fears of Chinese surveillance.\n\nDrone and action camera leaker Igor Bogdanov posted numerous images on X showing off what is clearly a successor to the DJI Neo, likely to be called the Neo 2. Bogdanov has a relatively accurate track record for leaks, so the images may be coming from DJI’s upcoming official announcement. Judging purely by the pics, the new Neo drone sports an updated propeller cage and an expanded antenna on the back. It still appears to be the same small size as the first Neo, though it apparently has additional sensor bars on the front panel.\n\n👉You'll love the specs.) For now, here's just a little bit of info for you:👋 Gesture and voice control🌐 New omnidirectional sensors📸 2-axis gimbal🔋 19 minutes in the air🏠 Auto return home⚡️ Direct chargingand…We have to leave something for them.😉#djineo2 pic.twitter.com/d8cSP8lcp3\n\n— Igor Bogdanov (@Quadro_News) October 24, 2025\n\nAccording to Bogdanov, the new drone could include an enhanced battery life that promises 19 minutes of flying time compared to the previous 10 to 15 minutes on the first DJI Neo. Even better, the Neo 2 could support a 2-axis gimbal that will let you spy your surroundings without having to spin the drone along its x-axis. With those extra antennas, the new drone could have a larger range than the original Neo’s effective operating range of only 50 meters (without using a controller). The new DJI Neo 2 could even support omnidirectional sensors, which hints at possible obstacle avoidance you typically only get when you move up to the DJI Mini class for several hundred dollars more.\n\nThe added features could boost the DJI Neo 2’s price above the original $200 starting price (before you added additional accessories like a controller and multiple batteries). That is, if you can actually bring it to the U.S. once it’s officially on store shelves. The China-based company’s products—not just its drones—are facing a full ban on U.S. sales. In the meantime, the U.S. has effectively soft-banned all of the dronemaker’s imports. The federal government has labeled DJI a “Chinese Military Company” and claims its consumer-end drones represent a national security risk. Earlier this month, DJI filed an appeal over its designation with the U.S. Court of Appeals. Still, the end result is that U.S.-based buyers have very few options for purchasing DJI’s products.\n\nIt’s left many U.S. drone flyers pulling their hair out, as DJI still offers some of the best and most affordable flying cameras. Back in September, DJI showed off its Mini 5 Pro drone with a larger, 1-inch CMOS sensor inside its light frame. That drone was selling for 799 euros, or under $1,000 in U.S. dollars. It’s still not available for Stateside flyers.\n\nIn a statement, DJI told Gizmodo, “DJI remains dedicated to the U.S. market and is optimizing our strategy to best serve our customers amidst evolving local conditions.” If these drones were to come to the U.S., it would still need to deal with President Donald Trump’s love of tariffs and the ongoing international shipping snafu that is literally destroying shipments before they can get to consumers. So if you plan to order a new Neo from overseas, just make sure the little drone arrives at your door, or else UPS will literally go Ghostbusters on your poor package.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\nShare this story\n\nSubscribe and interact with our community, get up to date with our customised Newsletters and much more.\n\nWe're headed towards a real life Robocop.\n\nRegulators have launched probes after two Prime Air drones collided with a construction crane.\n\nSeveral NATO countries have seen mysterious drones flying in their airspace that many have pinned on Russian intrusions.\n\nFlock Safety's high-tech drones designed for cops are now being offered to private security firms.\n\nDanish officials have told NATO allies the drones are from \"state actors.\"\n\nThe DJI Osmo Nano would be extra enticing if only you could buy it in the U.S.\n\n©2025 GIZMODO USA LLC.\n\nAll rights reserved.",
