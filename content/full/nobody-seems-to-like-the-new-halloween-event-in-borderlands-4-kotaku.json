  "full_text": "Borderlands 4GearboxHalloween\n\nHalloween has reached Gearbox’s recently released looter shooter, Borderlands 4. But the free event is being heavily criticized online because, well, it sucks.\n\nAs we reach the end of October and get closer and closer to Halloween, many live-service and online games start to activate seasonal, limited-time, Halloween-themed events. Borderlands 4 is one of these games, and its new “Horrors of Kairos” event went live on October 23 and ends on November 6. And nobody really likes it, as the “event” is less of a big, in-game Halloween celebration and more of a small change to a pre-existing mechanic with two new weapons and some pumpkin-y skins.\n\nDouble, double, recoil and trouble 🎃💥\n\nDuring Horrors of Kairos, defeat World Bosses for a chance to earn two new Legendary weapons:\n\n💀 Legendary Order Grenade – Skully 💎 Legendary Tediore Assault Rifle – Murmur\n\nEvent ends Nov. 6.\n\n— Borderlands (@borderlands.2k.com) 2025-10-23T17:15:38.775Z\n\nBasically, the new Halloween event in Borderlands 4 changes how random world boss spawns work in the looter shooter. They still happen during “Horrors of Kairos,” but now, when you enter the boss’s holo-bubble to start the fight, the sky turns orange, and when you kill the big bad, they might drop one of the two new legendary guns temporarily available during the spooky event. Then the bubble closes and the sky goes back to normal. And uh, that’s it. Oh, and there are some free Halloween skins you can get from using a Shift code. Okay, that’s it.\n\nThis is not very exciting. And because world bosses spawn randomly in the open world, players have to just drive around waiting for a boss bubble to appear. And if you have a strong build, the fight might be over in less than a minute. Compared to Borderlands 3 and its big Halloween event, this is extremely disappointing. In the last game, the Halloween event introduced a new character, added a new limited-time map, featured a new boss, and more.\n\nBorderlands content creators are ripping the new event apart in YouTube videos and posts. Popular Borderlands YouTuber Joltzdude139 uploaded a new video on Friday that spelled it out simply and bluntly with the title: The Horrors Of Kairos Halloween Event Sucks In Borderlands 4. In the comments below, he added: “As a biiiiig Borderlands fan, I am absolutely disappointed in this Halloween event.” And he’s not alone. Checking Reddit, Twitter, YouTube, and elsewhere, everyone seems sad about it.\n\nSure, Gearbox advertised the Halloween update as a mini-event, but this feels more like a super-tiny event. I can’t wait for Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford’s 700-word tweet about all of this that will likely drop within the next 48 hours.\n\nDon’t miss the latest reviews, news and tips.
